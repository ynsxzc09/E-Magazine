            <h3>Akihabara Junk Street</h3>
            <p>Akihabara is located to the north of Tokyo Station. During the Edo period, it was an area prone to fires where lower-ranking samurais resided. The name, Akihabara, comes from a shrine that was build in 1870 to worship the firefighting god, Akibadaigongen. Today, it is known as one of the world's leading electric towns filled with retail stores selling consumer appliances and other electronic products. A back street known as Junk Street stretching from the intersection of Kuramae-hashi Dori and Chuo Dori, to Akiba Cultures Zone, is of particular interest. This street has numerous stores that handle items, such as computer parts, peripherals, keyboards and cords, that are hard to get from general electronics retail stores.</p>

            <h3>Tokyo Imperial Palace Area</h3>
            <p>The palace used to be the castle (the Edo Castle) of the Tokugawa shogunate, but it became the palace for the Imperial family in 1868. It had been called kyujo (the Imperial castle) since 1888, but in 1948, it was renamed to kokyo, the Imperial Palace. Within the Imperial Palace premises, there are 1) gosho, where their Majesties, the emperor and empress, reside; 2) kyuden (the Imperial Hall); and 3) other buildings for the Imperial Household Agency government offices.</p>

            <h3>Hachiko Statue</h3>
            <p>The bronze statue of Chuken Hachiko is in the square of Shibuya station, and is a popular meeting place. The model of this statue was an Akita dog Hachi, who was a pet of Hidesaburo Ueno, a professor in the Faculty of Agriculture at the University of Tokyo. Being brought up with a lot of love to become a faithful dog, it was Hachi's daily routine to greet the professor. When the professor suddenly passed away in 1925, Hachi continued to wait for his deceased master at Shibuya Station for 10 years. </p>

            <h3>Asakusa</h3>
            <p>Akihabara is well connected to Asakusa via the Tsukuba Express train line. Again here you will find a massive contrast between the electric town you just left and the more traditionally looking, yet busy, area of Asakusa. There is a lot to explore in this fascinating area, including Sensoji Temple; there is also the Nakamise shopping street which leads from the Kaminarimon entrance gate to the temple.</p>

            <h3>Meiji Jingu</h3>
            <p>This is a shrine that worships the Meiji Emperor and his wife, Empress Shoken. This shrine has the most visitors during New Year's holidays. There is a large forest that spreads over 700 thousand square meters in the inner garden of Meiji Shrine that has the main building in the center, and this forest has become an oasis for the citizens of Tokyo.
